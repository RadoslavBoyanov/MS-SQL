# MS-SQL
Databases are the standard way of using dynamic technology over time, making them an indispensable part of almost every application. The intensive database fundamentals course introduced me to one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of the world's information systems - Microsoft SQL Server. The course data pays close attention to relational models, modeling ER diagrams (tables and relational relationships), and working with the SQL language (data extraction, selection, projection, join, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion, and insertion).
