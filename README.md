# MS-SQL
Databases are the standard way of using dynamic technology over time, making them an indispensable part of almost every application. The intensive database fundamentals course introduced me to one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of the world's information systems - Microsoft SQL Server. The course data pays close attention to relational models, modeling ER diagrams (tables and relational relationships), and working with the SQL language (data extraction, selection, projection, join, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion, and insertion). Learn fundamentals of working with ACID transactions and transaction processing, and practical tips for performance tuning. This course lays the foundations of working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and to understand concepts such as converting a database into an object-oriented model (ORM).
Skills I have acquired:
 - Using procedures and functions
 - Fundamental knowledge of databases
 - Transaction management
 - Handling and storing data
 - Creation of basic Back-End architectures
 - Using the ACID model
